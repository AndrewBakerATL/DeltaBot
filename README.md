# Delta Bot
A Simple Discord Bot running on the discord.py API.

## The Why
Primarily, the reason is just to play around with the API with a few simple sample command structures to see how well it performs, and test the volatility.

### Planned Functionality
Welcome Commands, Autorole, Moderation Commands, Information Commands, User Experience System, Help Commands 

### Additionally
The API itself seems to work pretty well. Another reason is to test the long-term sustainability of the platform / extension.
